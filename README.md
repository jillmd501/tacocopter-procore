# Tacocopter Procore Challenge

Here in Santa Barbara, we're passionate about our tacos. In fact, we get tacos catered for lunch every Wednesday. When we go out for lunch, though, we want to make sure the shop we go to has the right fillings and sauces to satisfy everyone.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to help us by writing a Rails app that solves this conundrum.
